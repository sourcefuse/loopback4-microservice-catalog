# FeatureToggleExample

This application is generated using [LoopBack 4 CLI](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Command-line-interface.html) with the
[initial project layout](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Loopback-application-layout.html).

## STEP 1: Install dependencies

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```
## STEP 2: Set up Environment Variables
1. Copy the .env.example file to .env:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
2. Open the .env file and configure the necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection settings, JWT secret keys).

## STEP 3: Database Migration
Run the following command to migrate the database:
```sh
npm run db:migrate
```

## STEP 4: Set up JWT Asymmetric Authentication
This project uses JWT tokens for authentication. Ensure you have the following:
* A private key (JWT_PRIVATE_KEY) for signing the JWT tokens.
* A public key (JWT_PUBLIC_KEY) for verifying the JWT tokens.

Add these keys to the .env file or ensure they are properly configured in your authentication service.

## STEP 5: Start the application
Once everything is set up, you can start the Node.js application with the following command:
```sh
npm start
```
This will start the server, and you can begin testing the API.

## STEP 6: Testing the API
After starting the application, you can test the API using Swagger UI. Open your browser and visit:

http://127.0.0.1:3000 Replace the URL according to your configuration

## Rebuild the project

To incrementally build the project:

```sh
npm run build
```

To force a full build by cleaning up cached artifacts:

```sh
npm run rebuild
```

## Fix code style and formatting issues

```sh
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix such issues:

```sh
npm run lint:fix
```

## Other useful commands
- `npm run openapi-spec`: Generate OpenAPI spec into a file
- `npm run docker:build`: Build a Docker image for this application
- `npm run docker:run`: Run this application inside a Docker container

## Tests

```sh
npm test
```

## Troubleshooting
* Ensure that your database is correctly configured and running.
* Make sure that the JWT private and public keys are properly set up in the .env file.
* If you encounter issues with Swagger UI not loading, verify that the server has successfully started and that the correct port is specified.
